Challenge
----

This was a coding challenge to apply for a job at Trello. The goal is to "Get Taco's Recommendation", by having it print your name when the button is pressed. You can't change any of the JavaScript, just work with the URL.


What I learned
----

It was a tough problem. The biggest take away for me is a new kind of coding challenge. I'm used to problems like those in _Cracking the Coding Interview_, and at [Exercism](exercism.io) and [HackerRank](hackerrank.com). Getting Taco's recommendation forced me to read someone else's code and figure out how to manipulate it.
